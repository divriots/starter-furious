# starter-furious

`Furious` is a design system based on [FAST Frame](https://www.fast.design/docs/design-systems/fast-frame) created to be a starter-kit for your own design systems. It configures FAST Frame with sensible defaults, makes it ready for your extensions where needed and lays a foundation for your future documentation.

Click the "Edit" button to also see the source code in the [Backlight](https://backlight.dev/) editor.

## Highlights

- 🎁 Contains 40+ components from FAST Frame
- 📖 Showcases real working code in docs and stories
- 🎨 Explains design tokens with visual demos and practical code examples
- 👨‍🎨️ Has an experimental live-configurator to play with design tokens
- 📦 Published on NPM to try in your project

## Usage

## Documentation

### Design System Documentation

`Furious` is shipped with a good documentation basis which starts in the [core](https://backlight.dev/edit/xS11aQmjMLIvr5PU5Mru/core/doc/core.md) and then walks you through the usage of tokens and components.

### Backlight Documentation

We created [DS Mastery](https://backlight.dev/mastery/) to help you become a hero in the design system development.

To learn about Backlight features there is an [official documentation](https://backlight.dev/docs/) too.
